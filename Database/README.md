To create a database, first run preprocess_dataframe.py, selecting the filters. This will create a data base file

Second, to filter by obs, and to add the temperature info, run the notebook Preprocess by obs. The limits of the ctimes must be adjusted. The notebook doesnt run for me in jupyter, so I copied it to a script that does run.
