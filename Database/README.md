To create a database, first run preprocess_dataframe.py, selecting the filters. This will create a data base file that is filtered for the entire season.

Second, to filter by obs, and to add the temperature and the 2 hr info, run the notebook Preprocess by obs. The limits of the ctimes must be adjusted. The notebook doesnt run for me in jupyter, so I copied it to a script that does run.
